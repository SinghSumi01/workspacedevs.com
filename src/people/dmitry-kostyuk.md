Full-time Google Apps Script developer, founder at [Wurkspaces.dev](https://www.wurkspaces.dev).

I am an expert in Google Workspace automation. I specialize in simplifying and automating business processes for my clients with custom-built scripts and add-ons of all levels of complexity.

I have built marketing automation funnels, document merge solutions, chatbots, add-ons with restricted user access, webapps, file management apps with integration of Google Cloud technologies such as BigQuery, FireBase and Google Storage as well as numerous external APIs.

My code is clean, uses ES6+ syntax, has JS Doc comments, respects DRY and SOLID principles and makes use of relevant design patterns.
