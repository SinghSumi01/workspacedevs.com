I am a marketer turned engineer, who obsesses over removing friction from the customer journey.

My primary objective is not to maximize vanity metrics, but, instead to minimize lost opportunities. I am of the mind that a lost lead and a lost customer are equally disappointing.

I thrive on moving quickly, quantifying my efforts, and democratizing data through automation — in order to to identify new opportunities and optimize my team’s efforts.
